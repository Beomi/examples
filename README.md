# pywren examples

This is a repository of pywren examples, showing how to run various
example code and generate many of the plots used in blog posts.
Most examples have an explanation in a `README.md`, a script to run, and
often a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) for interactively examining
results. 

Note that these examples, in addition to requiring the latest pywren, 
often require additional packages like Jupyter/iPython, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
and the Ruffus pipeline manager.
