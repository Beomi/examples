# pywren examples

This is a repository of pywren examples, showing how to run various
example code and generate many of the plots used in blog posts.
Most examples have an explanation in a `README.md`, a script to run, and
often a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) for interactively examining
results.
